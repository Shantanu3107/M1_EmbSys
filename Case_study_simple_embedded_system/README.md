## Microcontroller 
The microprocessor is the brains of the MP3 player. When you use the controls to choose and play a song, the microprocessor sends directions to the digital signal processor (DSP) telling it what to do. The DSP performs the mathematical calculations necessary to decode the digitized music.

## Flash memory
By using a portable version of a media player, you can listen to music from the USB memory stick wherever you find a USB port.Thereafter, plug the flash drive into any computer or device with a USB port and click the app on the flash drive to launch the portable media player

## Desktop pc parallel port
In computing, a parallel port is a type of interface found on early computers (personal and otherwise) for connecting peripherals. The name refers to the way the data is sent; parallel ports send multiple bits of data at once (parallel communication), as opposed to serial communication, in which bits are sent one at a time. To do this, parallel ports require multiple data lines in their cables and port connectors and tend to be larger than contemporary serial ports, which only require one data line.

## Keypad and LCD
Keypad is given to give input signals such as play , pause , next , etc to the MP3 player and LCD display the output uch as which track is being played or how long is the long in minutes and seconds .

## MIC 
Mic is used to take input in the MP3 player in the form of sound which is further processed into electrical signals and given to the MP3 .

## Headphone
Headphone acts as output for the sound signals that are given out by the MP3 player which are basically electrical signals that are processed and given out as sound signals .
